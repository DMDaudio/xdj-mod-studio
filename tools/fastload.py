"""fastload.py -- SHARED fast block loader for deck installers.

Why: the byte-write (BW) path costs one shell round per byte. Real-world
installs wall-clock at ~30 min and twice (2026-10-04) long sessions wedged
the deck's USB link. This module cuts that:

  * one LW (32-bit, table-verified command) per 4 aligned bytes -> ~4x
    fewer rounds than BW,
  * no per-write drain: commands are pipelined in bursts, the deck replies
    are drained AFTER the burst (BW could not be trusted unsynced; LW's
    handler is a single mov.l per the decoded table + handler disasm),
  * every 4 B pays an aligned write so no partial-word hazards,
  * read-back verification per session block (BR 32 bytes per round),
  * fail-stop on any verify mismatch, and NEVER arms hooks here - the
    arming session stays tiny and separately paced (shell session rules:
    one open per command, 30 s pacing handled by the calling installer).

API:
    fastblock(h, base, blob) -> None    write blob at base (4-aligned),
                                        pipelined LW bursts + BR verify
    lw_selftest(h, addr) -> bool        write-read-back-restore of one
                                        scratch word in a KNOWN-EMPTY area
                                        of our own cave
    BR32(h, base, size) -> bytes        block read in 32-B rounds

Safety: RAM window only (0x08000000-0x0FFFFFFF, asserted), fail-stop,
verify-after-write like every installer. Nothing here touches flash or
hooks; installers keep the no-track / not-armed gates and do the arming
in their own fresh sessions.
